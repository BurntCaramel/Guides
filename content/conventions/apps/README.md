# Collected-Compatible Apps

Collected-compatible apps connect to an API that conform to the [Collected schemas](/conventions/schemas/).

Apps can take on a number of forms. They may be chat-style applications, with a list of messages and chat field. They may be search engine style applications, with searching of all content quickly and intelligently. They may be well-curated publications of recent activity and long-lived documentation.
