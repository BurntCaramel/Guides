An open source Mac app for website auditing and crawling, which I first started in 2015.

- Crawl pages on any website
- Browse at various mobile, tablet, and freeform widths
- See title, h1, description, and internal & external links
- See status code, MIME type, bytes
- See meta tags such as description, open graph, viewport, etc
- Load and preview images
- Preview source HTML
- Export to CSV
