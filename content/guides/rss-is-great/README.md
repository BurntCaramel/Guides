# Why RSS is better than AMP

## Downsides of AMP

Google is concerned about raising the price of `GOOG` stock. AMP might be well intentioned, on reducing page weight and making a fast experience. But it’s a standard controlled by Google. It’s designed to keep users on Google Search. AMP is not the web, it does not have the goals of the web, and it’s not as open as the web.

## Benefits of RSS

RSS lets users just see the content. They can read without distractions, they can read it as they like without ads and tracking scripts.

Users can subscribe to RSS, and read it when and how they like. There’s multiple clients for RSS, on mobile, on PCs, and can be adapted easily. It’s a feed that is not controlled by a for-profit company like Facebook, Twitter, or Apple.
