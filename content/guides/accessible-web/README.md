# Guide to Accessible Web

## HTML is critical to get right

## Landmarks: where?

### The _main_ content

Do you ever skip the intro on Netflix? Imagine having to sit through a 2 minute sequence every time if that button didn’t exist. We’re not interested: we want the **main** part of the show. Every episode has the timestamp of when the _real_ show starts, and that’s what this skip button jumps ahead to.

The `<main>` element is similar. It holds the primary content that the user is interested in. The user can _skip_ ahead. Past repetitive stuff like navigation links and legal text, and so these should be kept outside of `<main>`.

### _Navigating_ around

### _Searching_

### _Articles_ of interest

### Headers and footers

### Heirarchy of importance

## Roles: what?

## Widgets: how?

## Patterns

- [Accessible Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/introduction/) aims to “bridge the gap between providers of websites and users with special needs.”
- [Accessibility for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) by Laura Kalbag is “an enjoyable and practical introduction to accessibility, covering everything from background knowledge to front-end implementation (and many things between).” — Léonie Watson
