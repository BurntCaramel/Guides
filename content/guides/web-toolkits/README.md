A richly featured yet lightweight foundation for single page apps. Its bundle size is 4.5KB, which includes a router.

It prerenders the homepage to improve performance for slower connections, and can be set up to prerender subpages too. You can customize the underlying Webpack config. A new version of preact-cli is currently under development, which incorporates Webpack 4 and other enhancements.

Because it starts so lightweight, other frameworks such as React, Vue, or Elm can be added on top.
